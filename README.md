# Data-Visualisation

Customer satisfaction is important in retaining customers, especially in the service industry.
An airline in the UK is currently conducting a study regarding its customer satisfaction. The
airline aims to understand what the main factors influencing the customer satisfaction are,
so that they can improve their service level. The marketing manager will use this
information to improve their service quality regarding tickets booking, boarding and
onboard experience. The marketing manager also wants to have a predictive model that will
determine whether a new customer will be satisfied given their answers and their
characteristics.


Details of the dataset:

Target variable
 Satisfaction: airline satisfaction level (“neutral or dissatisfied” and “satisfied”)

Personal details
 Gender: (female; male)
 Customer Type: (loyal customer; disloyal customer)
 Age: (age of each customer)
 Type of Travel: (types of journeys - business travel; personal travel)
 Class: (ticket class - business; economy; eco plus)
Flight details
 Flight Distance: (the flight distance of this journey in miles)
 Departure Delay in Minutes: (minutes of delay when departing)
 Arrival Delay in Minutes: (minutes of delay when arriving)
Pre-boarding (5 – is totally satisfied, 1 – totally dissatisfied)
 Ease of Online booking: (satisfaction level of online booking; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Departure/Arrival time convenient: (satisfaction level of departure/ arrival time
convenient; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Gate location: (satisfaction of gate location; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Online boarding: (satisfaction level of online boarding; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
Onboard (5 – is totally satisfied, 1 – totally dissatisfied)
 Inflight wifi service: (satisfaction level of the inflight wi-fi service; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Food and drink: (satisfaction level of food and drink; 0:NA; 1 – 5
Seat comfort: (satisfaction level of seat comfort; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Inflight entertainment: (satisfaction level of inflight entertainment; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 On-board service: (satisfaction level of on-board service; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Leg room service: (satisfaction level of leg room service; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Baggage handling: (satisfaction level of leg room service; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Checkin service: (satisfaction level of check-in service; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Inflight service: (satisfaction level of inflight service; 0:NA; 1 – 5)
 Cleanliness: (satisfaction level of cleanliness; 0:NA; 1 – 5)


The report  discuss all the variables contained in the
dataset, and for each variable your answer should address the questions:
 Which variables appear to be important for the task at hand, and why? Support your
claims with appropriate visualization and outputs that show whether and how
important each variable is.
 Are different variables related? Which variables convey information similar to that
provided in other variable(s)?
 What are the most common characteristics among the passengers? Use appropriate
dimensionality reduction techniques to answer this question.


Modelling & Prediction:

For each classification method develop one or a few candidate models that you think are promising before providing a final recommendation of the most appropriate model. Compare the approaches and select the most appropriate one. 

In order to ensure that the airline company makes correct decision, the marketing manager wants to make sure that:
◦ 95% of dissatisfied customers are identified correctly,
◦ no more than 10% of satisfied customers are mistakenly predicted to be
dissatisfied.
 Explain the trade-off between correctly identifying the satisfaction vs dissatisfaction
of clients. Present the trade-off visually. Explain how the results of classification
would change if the goal was different?
 How many variables (and which) are actually needed to construct a sufficiently good
classification model? Which of the variables can be considered as more important in
the prediction of satisfaction? Explain why the selected variables are important.
 Comment on the expected generalisation performance. In other words, how well do
you believe these models will perform when they are deployed?
